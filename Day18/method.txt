-- Calculate hoy many extrra faces a square adds to count--

1. First square adds 6
2. When adding a square, it adds +(6 - "How many squares it has close by 1 unit in 1 axis * 2")

-- Calculate hoy many squares a new squares has 1 unit close in 1 axis--

1. Loop over  all cubes:
	1.1. If cube has same value on 2 axis and 1 unit different on the other:
		1.1.1. It's close
	1.2 Else not.
